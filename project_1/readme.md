## Rota planning app for use in the Bell Jar

## BRIEF:

Build an app that lets you write rotas for employee shifts in the Bell Jar (a pub with a small pool of staff in the Southside of Glasgow). It should automate some of the more tedious processes of putting together a weekly rota, and make aspects of the task easier than they currently are. The owner/manager of the pub (Steve) should be able to create, edit and delete Rotas and Staff, while the Staff can view their shifts for the week as well as the full rota.

### MVP:
* The app should allow Steve to create, edit and remove staff members
* Staff members should be able to edit their profiles on the app to indicate their availability by day, and the maximum and minimum amount of hours that they would like to work
* The app should also allow Steve to write a rota for the week, with the information about staff availability and hours displayed so that he can write a rota that satisfies as many staff members as possible
* The staff should be able to view the rota in full, or by staff member, or by day.
* Steve should be able to write notes about various daysâ€”e.g. "on Sunday there is a function and that there will be one extra member of staff", or "Friday closed for Christmas"

### Possible Extensions:
* Allow staff members to request to swap shifts with other staff members
* Allow staff members to call in sick for shifts, and for that to be reflected in the rota
* Allow the create/edit rota screens to display whether the current configuration is satisfying the staff availability and hours needs
* Create an auto-write function that randomly allocates staff only to shifts that they are available to do, without rotaing staff in for too many or too few hours
* Create a template for the rota that indicates whether more or less staff are needed on specific days, and whether certain shifts need to be covered or not.
* Create a function that allows you to recall previous week's rotas as a starting point for writing the next week's one
